\section*{Planes in $ \mathbb{R}^3 $}
    Planes are a flat surface that exist in the vector space $ \mathbb{R}^3 $.
    \subsection*{The equation of a plane}
        For $ n \geq 2 \in\mathbb{R}^n $, the plane equation is as follows:
        \begin{definition}[Plane]
            \[
                \left\{ \mathbf{p} + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w} \ | \ s, t \in \mathbb{R} \right\}
            \]
            At a certain point $ \mathbf{x} $, we have that the equation of the plane becomes
            \[
                \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{p} + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w}
            \] 
            \noindent Given three position vectors, we can deduce that the direction vectors $ \mathbf{v} $ and $ \mathbf{w} $ become the differences $ \mathbf{p_2 - p_1}, \ \mathbf{p_3 - p_1} $. Since the difference of two vectors creates a separate 'distance' vector that points from head to head.
        \end{definition}    
    \subsection*{Parametric equations}
        The equation for a specific point in a plane $ x = \left[ x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3 \right] $ for a plane in $ \mathbb{R}^n, \ n \geq 3 $ is given by the equation
        \[
            \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{p} + s \mathbf{v} + t \mathbf{w}
        \]
        which satisfies
        \[
            \mathbf{x_1} = \mathbf{p_1} + s \mathbf{v_1} + t \mathbf{w_2}, \ \mathbf{x_2} = \mathbf{p_2} + s \mathbf{v_2} + t \mathbf{w_2}, \ \mathbf{x_3} = \mathbf{p_3} + s \mathbf{v_3} + t \mathbf{w_3}
        \]
    \subsection*{The general equation of a plane}
        Similar to lines, the general equation of a plane is given by
        \[
            ax + by +cz = d
        \]
        where the non-zero normal vector $ \mathbf{n} = \left[ a \ b \ c \right] $ is orthogonal to the plane - implying that it is orthogonal to the direction vectors $ \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{p_2 - p_1} $ and $ \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{p_3 - p_1} $.
        Also similar to lines, the general equation for the plane is equivalent to the equation
        \[
            \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{p}
        \]
        Which is called the \textbf{normal form of the equation of the plane.} since it is equivalent to $ \mathbf{n} \cdot ( \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{p}) = 0 $. In vector notation, this equation is represented as
        \[
            \left[ a \ b \ c \right] \cdot \left[ x \ y \ z \right] = \left[ a \ b \ c \right] \cdot \left[ p_1 \ p_2 \ p_3 \right]
        \]
